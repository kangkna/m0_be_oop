# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? It was very tough to go through these challenges and many times I feel like I've hit the wall but my peers helped me a lot going through these challenges and I could not have done it without them.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
Today I was able to take some rests and it definitely helped clear out my brain and gave me energy to go back to the questions that I was stuck on.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
I would definitely need a lot of support from my peers as they I have many things to learn from them. From my side I would definitely try going over the work that we did in Mod0 just so that I do not get confused with basic stuff.
